Founded in 2023, we build intelligent systems that combine the power of large language models with precise information retrieval. Our mission is to make AI more accurate, transparent, and useful by grounding AI responses in verified information sources.

Q: What is the history of RAGent AI?
A: RAGent AI was founded in 2023 by Dr. Sarah Chen and Dr. Michael Rodriguez, both former researchers at leading AI labs. The company secured $25 million in seed funding from Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. In 2024, the company expanded internationally and launched its first commercial products. By 2025, RAGent AI has become one of the fastest-growing AI startups, with a valuation exceeding $500 million.

Q: What products does RAGent AI offer?
A: RAGent AI offers three main product lines: RAGent Search (enterprise search solution), RAGent Assistant (customizable AI assistants), and RAGent Analytics (data analysis with RAG capabilities). Each product is available in Basic, Professional, and Enterprise tiers with varying features and support levels. Our newest offering, RAGent Connect, provides API access to our RAG infrastructure for developers.

Q: Can you describe RAGent Search in more detail?
A: RAGent Search is our flagship enterprise search solution that transforms how organizations find and utilize their internal knowledge. It indexes documents across multiple repositories (SharePoint, Google Drive, Confluence, etc.) and enables natural language queries with precise, source-attributed answers. Key features include multi-language support, document-level access controls, custom knowledge domains, and an analytics dashboard to track usage patterns and knowledge gaps.

Q: What makes RAGent Assistant unique?
A: RAGent Assistant stands out by combining the conversational abilities of LLMs with enterprise-grade information retrieval. Unlike generic AI assistants, RAGent Assistant is deeply integrated with your organization's knowledge base and can be customized for specific domains like legal, healthcare, finance, or customer support. It features built-in citation of sources, confidence scoring, human-in-the-loop verification for critical information, and seamless integration with existing workflow tools.

Q: How does RAGent Analytics work?
A: RAGent Analytics transforms how organizations extract insights from their data. It combines traditional business intelligence capabilities with natural language interfaces and RAG technology. Users can ask complex analytical questions in plain English, and the system will retrieve relevant data, perform appropriate analyses, and generate insights with visualizations. The system maintains a comprehensive audit trail of data sources and analytical methods used for each insight.
